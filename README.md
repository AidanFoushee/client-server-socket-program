# Overview

I started creating this project to further my learning about networking and to see what I can create.

I wrote 2 programs, one for the server and one for the client. The program works by running the server and then connecting the clients to it. You can do this by navigating in the terminal to the directory where the server/client program is, and then running the command 'python3 server.py' or 'python3 client.py' to run the corrosponding programs. The server needs to be running before the client, so that the client can connect to the server. You will know that the client is connected to the server when you see 'Connection Established' printed in the server terminal. The software is a story making game, where 2 clients can alternate sending words to the server to make a story.

My purpose for writing this software is to demonstrate my ability to learn something new and to further my learning and expand my knowledge.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running (you will need to show two pieces of software running and communicating with each other) and a walkthrough of the code.}
